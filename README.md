# **CS 388 Lab 1: Tap Counter App**
## Overview
In this lab, I built a simple counter app, similar to popular idle tap mobile games.

Idle tap games track the number of times a user has tapped on the screen, and allow users to accumulate points that can be exchanged for upgrades.

## 🎯 Goals
Gain a basic understanding of the programming language Kotlin
Build screen layouts using ConstraintLayout
Understand how to handle user interaction
For example, how do you know when the user has clicked on a specific button?
Understand how to update UI (User Interface) based on user interaction
Understand how to display Toasts, a simple feedback about an operation in a small popup

## Application Features
User can see a number displayed on the screen. The number starts at 0.
User can tap on a button to see the number displayed increase by 1.
User can exchange number of taps accumulated for upgrades:
User can exchange 100 taps for an upgrade where each tap will count as 2 taps
Customized the app with a dog theme using a dog background and a paw print button.
